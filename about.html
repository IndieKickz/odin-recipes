        <p>This is a website that I put together for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>. If I am being entrely honest, I have never actually cooked any of the recipes included on this site. I am not passionate about cooking and can barely make myself a bowl of cereal and sometimes if I'm feeling really ambitious, a sandwich.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even though I have never used any of the recipes included in this project site, I wanted to complete the project so that I could get some more practice with HTML, CSS, git & github. The latter two being entirely new to me as of the start of this project.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I made sure to select recipes for foods that are actually some of my all time favorites that were reviewed well on the website that The Odin Project referenced.<a href="https://www.allrecipes.com">(AllRecipes)</a></p>
