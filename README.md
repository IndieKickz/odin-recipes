This is a "website" I am building for The Odin Project. It takes advantage of the html & css that I've learned both from The Odin Project curriculum and from other sources I've researched on my own. 

The poritions of The Odin Project that are concerned with git & GitHub are the only times I have ever used both systems. My goal is to become more acquainted with git & GitHub over the course of this project. I am already somewhat versed in html & css so I plan to focus less on that aspect of this project.
